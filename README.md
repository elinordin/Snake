Snake
The brief was to work with vanilla JavaScript to create a website that takes user input and responds to it. I worked with keyboard-events, click-events and input-events. The most important thing for me was to practice to come up with the logic myself and to not follow any snake-turtorial. For this purpose I created flowcharts and developed them as I went along.
