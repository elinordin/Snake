# Snake
---
Hyper Island - Design for the user module - Brief 2.


### :scroll: Brief:
Make an interactive website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We were not allowed to use frameworks or external API's, and we did not have to support mobile.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
3 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
The most important thing for me was to practice to come up with the logic myself and break down a problem instead of following a turtorial. I also wanted to feel more comfortable and gain some confidence in general with programming.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
I decided to create a snake-game to get me into the strechzone but not into the danger zone. To reach my goal I started with making a flowchart with the game-logic and as challanges came along I developed that flowchart to break down problems further. I also developed my flowchart when I reached the point of adding some of my nice-to-haves like a highscore-board. The flowcharts are found in the Documentation-folder of this repository.


### :closed_book: Learnings:

* Confidence that I can break down a problem myself without a turtorial
* Deeper understanding of objects, arrays and objects within arrays
* The basics of canvas
* Different event listeners (keydown, input and click)
* I love flowcharts


### :computer: Tech used in this specific repository:
* JavaScript
* [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
* CSS
* HTML
